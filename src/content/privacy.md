## Privacy Policy for Deck

**Last Updated: February 4, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how **Deck** ("the App") handles your data. Deck is a digital DJ deck application designed for local audio playback.

### 1. Data Collection and Usage

#### Local Audio Files
Deck requires access to your device's audio files (via the `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` or `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions) solely to allow you to browse and load your own music library for playback and mixing within the App. 
- **No Uploading:** Your audio files are never uploaded to our servers or any third-party servers.
- **No Metadata Transmission:** We do not transmit metadata (artist, title, etc.) from your files to any server.

#### Local Caching
To provide a fast experience, the App generates and stores waveform data, BPM, beat grid, and track metadata (artist, title, duration, etc.) on your device's local storage. This data remains on your device and is not shared or transmitted.

### 2. Data Sharing
We do **not** share any personal information, audio data, or usage statistics with third parties. The App does not contain any third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking pixels.

### 3. Permissions Justification
- **Foreground Service / Media Playback:** Used to keep audio playing when the App is in the background or the screen is off. A persistent notification is displayed while the service is active.
- **Wake Lock:** Used to prevent the screen from dimming during a performance.
- **Storage Access:** Necessary for you to select and play your music files.

### 4. Children's Privacy
Deck does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Since the App does not collect any data at all, it is safe for users of all ages.

### 5. Data Retention and Deletion
All cached data (waveforms, beat grids, metadata) is stored locally on your device. You can remove it at any time by clearing the App's data in your device settings or by uninstalling the App.

### 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.
